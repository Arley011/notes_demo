# notes_demo

  Here is an App with 2 screens - one is a list of notes with title, description and photo, and another one, which opens after clicking '+' button, is a screen for adding a new note.
  
  
  I know that this app could be better with using State Management and Provider Package, storing and fetching data with SQLite, navigation with pushNamed() instead of push(). But I'm still learning Flutter and don't want to use features which I don't understand well.
